## Equipment Usage Optimization

### Dehydrator Schedule & Strategy

**June-July: Herbs**
- Dry excess basil, parsley for winter use

- Energy cost: ~$0.50/batch (24 hrs)

---

### Freezer Strategy & Inventory

**May-August: Freeze Pesto**
- Make large batches when basil is abundant

- Store flat in freezer bags (saves space)
- Thaw and jar as "fresh-made" through winter
- Shelf life frozen: 6-8 months

**June-August: Emergency Berry Storage**
- If overwhelmed, freeze berries whole
- Make jam in fall/winter when time allows
- Shelf life frozen: 12 months

**September-October: Apple Sauce**

- Freeze in quart containers
- Can properly when jars available
- Shelf life frozen: 12 months

**Organization:**

## Production Tips & Best Practices

### Efficiency Strategies

**Theme Days Save Time:**
- Make one type of brine → multiple pickle products
- Process tomatoes once → multiple sauces
- Similar techniques across products = muscle memory

**Batch Sizing:**
- Small batches (10-20 jars): Better for learning, variety
- Large batches (50-75 jars): More efficient for staples
- Match batch size to your energy level

**Recipe Scaling:**
- Use spreadsheet to scale ingredients
- Keep notes on what works
- Consistency = repeat customers

**Prep Ahead:**
- Sterilize jars the night before
- Prep ingredients in batches
- Make brines/syrups in advance

---

### Quality Control

**Before Processing:**
- Use ripe but firm produce
- Discard damaged items
- Consistent sizing for even cooking

**During Processing:**
- Accurate measurements (especially acid in pickles)
- Proper headspace in jars
- Remove air bubbles
- Clean jar rims

**After Processing:**
- Check seals (lid should not flex)
- Label immediately (easy to forget!)
- Note batch number/date
- Store properly

**Testing:**
- Taste test before scaling up
- Ask friends/family for feedback
- Adjust recipes if needed
- Document changes

---

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Don't:**
- ❌ Over-pack jars (they might not seal)
- ❌ Under-process (food safety risk)
- ❌ Skip testing new recipes
- ❌ Process when exhausted (mistakes happen)
- ❌ Forget to label jars (you WILL forget what's what)
- ❌ Store in warm/bright areas (degrades quality)
- ❌ Try to do everything in year one

**Do:**
- ✅ Start small and build
- ✅ Ask for help during peak times
- ✅ Take breaks (it's marathon, not sprint)
- ✅ Document everything
- ✅ Rest in winter
- ✅ Celebrate successes
